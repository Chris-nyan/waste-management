ðŸ“˜ GitHub Workflow Manual

ðŸ”¹ 1. Branch Structure

We will use the following main branches:
	â€¢	main â†’ Production-ready, stable code.
	â€¢	develop â†’ Active development branch (where features are merged before release).
	â€¢	feature/* â†’ Feature-specific branches created from develop.
	â€¢	release/* â†’ Pre-release branch for final testing (optional).
	â€¢	hotfix/* â†’ Urgent bug fixes created from main.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Workflow Steps

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>

Step 2: Always Update Local Branches

Before starting work:

git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

Step 3: Create a Feature Branch

Each feature or task should have its own branch:

git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>

ðŸ”¹ Examples:
	â€¢	feature/authentication
	â€¢	feature/user-profile

Step 4: Commit Frequently
	â€¢	Use small, meaningful commits.
	â€¢	Follow this format:

feat: add user login API
fix: resolve profile image bug
docs: update README with setup guide
refactor: clean up auth controller

Step 5: Push Your Branch

git push origin feature/<feature-name>

Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR)
	â€¢	PR from feature/<feature-name> â†’ develop
	â€¢	Request review from the other developer.
	â€¢	Address feedback and resolve conflicts.

Step 7: Merge to develop
	â€¢	Only after approval.
	â€¢	Never merge directly to main.

Step 8: Release

When ready for release:
	1.	Create release/<version> from develop.
	2.	Test & fix minor bugs.
	3.	Merge release/<version> â†’ main and tag version.
	4.	Merge back into develop to keep sync.

Step 9: Hotfixes (Urgent Bugs)
	â€¢	Create hotfix/<bug-name> from main.
	â€¢	Fix, test, and merge back to both main and develop.
